# Healthcare Insights Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze hospital data and generate actionable insights. The goal is to identify key trends, correlations, and patterns in patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and hospital operations. Through interactive and visually engaging dashboards, this analysis supports better decision-making and enhances operational effectiveness in healthcare settings.

## Dataset
This project utilizes two Excel sheets containing patient and hospital data. The dataset includes:

1. **Patient Information**
- Patient: Unique identifier
- PatientName: Full name
- Age: Age at admission
- Gender: Gender
- Bloodtype: Blood type
- Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis
- Treatment: Administered treatment(s)
- AdmissionDate: Admission date
- DischargeDate: Discharge date
- TotalBill: Total cost of stay
- Full Prescription Details: Medication details
2. **Hospital and Staff Information**
- Patient: Unique identifier
- Hospital: Name of hospital
- DoctorName: Attending doctor
- RoomNumber: Room number
- DailyCost: Daily cost of stay
- Treatment: Administered treatment(s)
- RecoveryRating: Patient's recovery rating

This dataset provides key insights into patient care, hospital operations, and financial data.

## Tools and Skills
- **Power BI**: Developed dynamic visualizations and an interactive dashboard.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed in-depth analysis of hospital and patient data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied statistical methods to uncover trends and correlations in the data.
- **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: Interpreted analytical results with a strong understanding of healthcare operations and patient care.

## Business Question
**How can the hospital optimize treatment costs while maintaining or improving patient recovery outcomes across different age groups and treatment types?**

## Insights and Answers
1. **Cost Analysis Across Treatment Types:**
- **Observation:** Surgery incurs the highest average costs per patient.
- **Actionable Insight:** Consider alternative treatments like physical therapy or medication for applicable conditions, as these may reduce costs while maintaining effectiveness.
- 
2. **Treatment Costs vs. Recovery Rating:**
- **Observation:** Surgery, while expensive, does not always correlate with the highest recovery ratings.
- **Actionable Insight:** Increase focus on treatments such as counseling, which demonstrate high recovery ratings and lower costs, to optimize both patient outcomes and financial efficiency.

3. **Age Group Analysis:**
- **Observation:** Recovery rating variability is highest among seniors, indicating that different age groups respond differently to treatments.
- **Actionable Insight:** Tailor treatment plans based on age-specific recovery data to allocate resources more effectively and improve outcomes across all age groups.

4. **Trends in Patient Admissions Over Time:**
- **Observation:** Peak admission months correlate with specific diagnoses.
- **Actionable Insight:** Use admission trends to better manage resources during high-demand periods, optimizing both patient care and operational efficiency.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
1. **Age Groups and Recovery Rates**:
   - Classified patients into Child, Adult, and Senior groups.
   - Identified significant variability in recovery ratings, particularly among seniors.

2. **Cost Analysis Across Treatment Types**:
   - Analyzed average treatment costs, noting surgery as the highest-cost treatment.

3. **Gender-Based Diagnosis Distribution**:
   - Examined diagnosis distribution by gender, identifying conditions more prevalent in specific genders.

4. **Analysis of Recovery Ratings**:
   - Assessed average recovery ratings across treatment categories, with counseling achieving the highest ratings.

5. **Hospital Utilization Metrics**:
   - Evaluated hospital admissions and room occupancy, highlighting facilities with high utilization.

6. **Treatment Effectiveness and Length of Stay**:
   - Correlated treatment effectiveness with patient length of stay, noting that some treatments with longer stays had lower recovery ratings.

7. **Hospital Cost Comparisons**:
   - Compared treatment costs across hospitals, identifying a facility with significantly higher costs.

8. **Patient Admission Trends Over Time**:
    - Analyzed monthly admission trends, correlating peaks with specific diagnoses.

9. **Age-Related Recovery Patterns**:
    - Investigated age influences on recovery, finding consistency across age groups without strong age-related correlation.

10. **Recovery Trends by Demographics**:
    - Analyzed recovery rates by gender and age, with adults showing higher recovery rates and more frequent admissions.

11. **Hospital Performance and Patient Outcomes**:
    - Evaluated hospitals based on admissions and recovery, identifying a facility with high admissions but lower recovery ratings.

12. **Cohort Analysis Based on Admission Dates**:
    - Conducted cohort analysis by admission date, noting months with lower recovery ratings possibly due to higher admission volumes.

## Key Findings
1. **Patient Demographics**: Significant trends were identified in patient age groups and gender-specific diagnosis patterns.
2. **Treatment Costs**: Insights into cost distributions across treatment categories, with potential areas for cost optimization highlighted.
3. **Hospital Utilization**: Analysis of resource usage enabled recommendations for more effective resource management.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between patient characteristics and healthcare outcomes were explored, informing data-driven decision-making.

## Takeaways
- Power BI is a powerful tool for healthcare organizations to transform data into meaningful insights, driving improved patient care and operational efficiency.
- Understanding patient demographics and treatment patterns is crucial for optimizing healthcare delivery and resource allocation.
- Data-driven strategies help healthcare providers pinpoint areas for improvement, enabling better-targeted interventions and enhanced patient outcomes.
- Ongoing analysis and monitoring of healthcare data are vital for recognizing trends and proactively addressing challenges in the healthcare industry.
